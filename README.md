# SnakeSFML
A classic Snake game implemented in C++ using the SFML.
The game features a snake that moves around the screen, growing in length each time it consumes an apple. The player controls the snake's direction using arrow keys while avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake's own body. The objective is to achieve the highest possible score by eating apples.

Features
-Simple and intuitive controls: Up, Down, Left, and Right arrow keys.
-Dynamic snake growth and scoring system.
-Collision detection for walls and self.
-Randomly spawning apples to keep the game challenging.
